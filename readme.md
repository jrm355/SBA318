# This is my server for a dog casting website where you can input a dog you're interested in casting and who can be recieved on a seperate page, and filtered (the pages are connected for the sake of the project)
## Much of this assignment is really just me playing around with the express server. The routes are clearly defined in the notes on what they do and how they work. some need to be manipulated using the terminal and using curl. Any creative drive I initally had was set aside to meet the rubric critera. It's simply showing a built server.
## I utilized past notes, as well as online rescources to produce this code. The data is made up. 
### I had fun messing around with the server. Ignoring the stress of the grading of the KBA, they really are the point where I cement what I'm learning. the view engine step tripped me up. I left the static html casting.html in even though it isn't being utilized. 
#### that all said this project was quite the nuisance for me, and I spent way more time than I thought I would. For the record, it's not that this project is hard persay, it's just this was all taught in a very short period of time and most of the concepts didn't really resonate with me until I was actually on my own doing them. I think I approached things incorrectly and feel like I spent three or four times as much time as I needed to.
