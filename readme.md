# This is my server for a friendship website of Dog owners (idea would be the match people based on dog type, age, etc.)
## the idea is to be able to add dog actors on the add dog actors page and for them to show up on the casting page. Much of this assignment is really just me playing around with the express server. This really isn't a very creative project, it's simply showing a built server.
## I utilized past notes, as well as online rescources to produce this code. The data is made up. 
### I had fun messing around with the server. Ignoring the stress of the grading of the KBA, they really are the point where I cement what I'm learning. the view engine step tripped me up. I left the static html casting.html in even though it isn't being utilized. 
#### that all said this project was a nightmare for me, and I spent way more time than I thought I would. For the record, it's not that this porject is hard persay, it's just this was all taught in a very short period of time and most of the concepts didn't really resonate with me until I was actually on my own doing them.
